## Graph Specific Slide {.graph-slide}

There are classes for all the dataviz types, available via `{.graph-slide}` etc

The classes customise the following: 

- Headers are the primary colour
- Body text is the tertiary darker colour

At present [Updated May 2025] Quarto doesn't have a solution for pointing to a remote _brand.yml file. But if it did might want to use some of the colours here.
